# Stream Application

It is a learning project under the course 'Modern React with Redux' on the udemy. It is a streaming application where a user can create channels/streams, show streams somewhat like https://www.twitch.tv/ but not exact.
 
It provided me an opportunity to learn different concepts of React.  

<hr>

- Navigation with React Router
- Handling Authentication (Google OAuth: add your project client id to work with it.)
- Redux form with validation
- Server implementation with JSON server (to launch the server open the 'api' directory and run the cmd 'npm run start' in the terminal and keep it running in background)
- Use Axios and redux-thunk to make a request to store the form values into the db.json
